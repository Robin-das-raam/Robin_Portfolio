# Project 1: Predicting the Auction Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning.
## Project Overview
* The project goal was to predict a number, so it's regression problem.
* Data used in this project was real world data. So there was lots of missing data.
* Explored the data and preprocessed the data.
* Created a Baseline model to see how well the model fitted .
* Feature Engineering: Created new Features to minimize the evaluation metric.
* Optimized Random Forest Regressor using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Evaluated the model with Root Mean Squared Log Error. 
* Tried to figure out the most important features.
